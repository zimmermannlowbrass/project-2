#  The New West Taghkanic Website

    # Mission
*For this project, I will create a website dedicated to the greatest diner in the Hudson Valley area*


    -Section 1: Home-

**Section 1**

This is the home page when you enter the webiste. Users will be greeted by photos of the diner as well as links to press and reviews. The homepage should be accessable by clicking either the title header or the title diner photo.


    -Section 2: Meals and Drinks-

**Section 2**

There are a listing of several meal options provided for the diner in the second tab. Users will be greeted with a photo of the food, a short description, a price, as well as a star review system. Users can change the rating system of any food item and persist the changes. The same is true for the third tab which fetches and populates drink options.


    -Section 3: Feedback Form-

**Section 3**

At the bottom of both the meal and the drink sections, there is a form for Users to suggest a food/drink be added to the menu. Users must submit the name, description, price, and optionally an image to persist the food to the API. Once submited, the new card should appear without having to refresh the page.

    -Section 4: About-

**Section 4**

This section is dedicated to the authenticity of the West Taghkonic Diner. Here, the user can find some historical information pertaining to the diner, an iFrame map from google for the location of the diner, and also a link to the actual website for the diner.






    -BONUS: Discover More Brewery Information-

**Learn more about any brewery**

User may drag any brewery option provided from the selection section over to the "learn more" section. When the user drops the brewery option, the information for the brewery (name, address, brewery type, website URL) will all be populated in the bottom section. If the user decides to learn more about a different brewery, they may feel free to drag over a new one. Upon dropping, the old brewery information will be replaced by the new dragged option.




    -API SOURCE and NOTES-
[Brewery API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation)







Here is the rough sketch for my react App --- 

Breakfast Diner Menu



Get - grab the initial API 
check

Patch - change a part of the menu item (ingrediant)
check

 

Post - Add a new item
Delete - Get rid of a menu item


next to do: 

make it so that the main website is accessable from clicking the photo at top
have the main website not be the about? Maybe create a HOME and a ABOUT section


















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
