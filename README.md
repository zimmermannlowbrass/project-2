#  The New West Taghkanic Website

    # Mission
*For this project, I will create a website dedicated to the greatest diner in the Hudson Valley area*


    -Section 1: Home-

**Section 1**

This is the home page when you enter the webiste. Users will be greeted by photos of the diner as well as links to press and reviews. The homepage should be accessable by clicking either the title header or the title diner photo.


    -Section 2: Meals and Drinks-

**Section 2**

There are a listing of several meal options provided for the diner in the second tab. Users will be greeted with a photo of the food, a short description, a price, as well as a star review system. Users can change the rating system of any food item and persist the changes. The same is true for the third tab which fetches and populates drink options.


    -Section 3: Feedback Form-

**Section 3**

At the bottom of both the meal and the drink sections, there is a form for Users to suggest a food/drink be added to the menu. Users must submit the name, description, price, and optionally an image to persist the food to the API. Once submited, the new card should appear without having to refresh the page.

    -Section 4: About-

**Section 4**

This section is dedicated to the authenticity of the West Taghkonic Diner. Here, the user can find some historical information pertaining to the diner, an iFrame map from google for the location of the diner, and also a link to the actual website for the diner.






    -BONUS: Discover More Brewery Information-

**Learn more about any brewery**

User may drag any brewery option provided from the selection section over to the "learn more" section. When the user drops the brewery option, the information for the brewery (name, address, brewery type, website URL) will all be populated in the bottom section. If the user decides to learn more about a different brewery, they may feel free to drag over a new one. Upon dropping, the old brewery information will be replaced by the new dragged option.
